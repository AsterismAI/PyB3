# B3 parser and outputter

Kerry N. Wood (kerry.wood@jhuapl.edu)

April 2023

This is Python-only code to parse and generate B3 formats for obs.

A test set was generated via the AstroStandards and this is tested against it.

ToDo:

- add more test data / edge cases

Notes:
- look at the `estm/kerry/OBS/Obs.ipynb` for some of the initial code
- CarMHF also has a rudimentary B3 parser (look in the ObsInterface)
