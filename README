This was modified from code in the `asctypes` and the `estm` code set.  It was tested by using the AstroStandards code to parse / output data and then re-generate with the Python code.
- look at the `estm/kerry/OBS/Obs.ipynb` for some of the initial code
- CarMHF also has a rudimentary B3 parser (look in the ObsInterface)
